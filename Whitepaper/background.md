# Background

## Introduction

The convergence of the Bitcoin ecosystem, decentralized trading, and memecoins is creating an unprecedented market transformation. With the emergence and development of Bitcoin-native protocols such as Runes, Ordinals, and BRC-20, there is a growing demand for faster and more user-friendly token creation and trading platforms. Particularly led by new trading platforms like Pump.fun and Odin.fun, memecoin trading requires more efficient market mechanisms to achieve seamless connectivity across different platforms and protocols, providing users with a complete end-to-end seamless experience from token creation to trading.

## Current Market Landscape

The Bitcoin token market has experienced explosive growth in recent years, especially driven by protocols such as Runes, Ordinals, and BRC-20. According to Dune Analytics data, as of 2024, token trading volume on Bitcoin has exceeded $25 billion\[1]. However, current Bitcoin token trading faces serious efficiency issues, with traditional on-chain transactions requiring block confirmation wait times, averaging 10 minutes to complete a transaction, and potentially taking hours during network congestion periods.

The rise of the Bitcoin memecoin market has attracted keen attention from global investors, with market size growing by over 600% from 2023 to 2024\[2]. However, current platforms generally suffer from slow transaction speeds and poor user experience, severely limiting market liquidity and participation. For example, mainstream trading platforms have an average transaction confirmation time of 10-40 minutes, while transaction fees during network congestion periods can be as high as $20-50 per transaction\[3].

The Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions market is developing rapidly, with Total Value Locked (TVL) expected to exceed $10 billion in 2025\[4]. Particularly, technical solutions that enable high-speed transactions, such as Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) and Multi-Party Computation (MPC), have brought revolutionary trading experiences to the Bitcoin ecosystem. Taking the Odin.fun platform as an example, its implementation based on the Valhalla layer enables transactions to achieve final confirmation within 32 seconds, significantly outperforming the traditional Bitcoin network's 10-minute block time. However, current platforms rarely achieve a balance between user-friendliness, security guarantees, and efficient market mechanisms.

The fragmentation of token creation and trading ecosystems forces users to switch between multiple platforms, increasing participation barriers and risks. This fragmented landscape both hinders new user entry and limits the network effects of the entire ecosystem. According to CoinMarketCap data, active users in the Bitcoin token market are scattered across more than 30 different platforms\[5].

## Market Opportunities and Growth

Latest market analysis indicates that the Bitcoin token ecosystem has enormous growth potential. By 2026, the Bitcoin token market is expected to reach $100 billion in scale, with a compound annual growth rate of approximately 82%\[6]. Particularly, platforms that enable near-instantaneous transactions are expected to attract a broader user base, including traditional cryptocurrency traders and emerging market users.

The memecoin market, as one of the fastest-growing segments in the crypto ecosystem, is expected to reach a $50 billion market cap by 2025\[7]. Bitcoin, as the oldest and most secure blockchain, provides an unparalleled foundation of trust and global recognition for memecoins. According to Galaxy Digital research, platforms building token economies on the Bitcoin network could capture a significant share of this rapidly growing market\[8].

Next-generation Bitcoin token trading platforms will redefine market standards by providing revolutionary user experiences. Platforms that are Bitcoin ecosystem-friendly, fast in transaction speed, and low in fees have the potential to become mainstream entry points. Innovative trading mechanisms, such as the combination of bonding curves (y = e^x) and Automated Market Makers (AMM, k = X \* Y), provide token creators with a smooth transition from initial issuance to liquid markets. Market research indicates that platforms capable of improving transaction speeds to the second level could attract 10 times more new users than existing platforms\[9]. Meanwhile, innovative features like "quick buy" and "quick sell" can reduce transaction times from minutes to seconds, greatly improving market activity.

## Key Challenges

Bitcoin token trading faces several core challenges that limit its large-scale adoption. First is the transaction speed issue, with Bitcoin network's 10-minute block time causing slow transaction confirmations, unable to meet modern traders' demands for immediacy. Although Layer 2 solutions like Lightning Network have made progress in the payment sector, efficient solutions specifically for token trading remain limited.

Second are user experience barriers, with most current Bitcoin token trading platforms requiring users to understand complex technical concepts such as UTXO, scripts, and transaction fee estimation. According to Chainalysis user research, over 70% of potential users abandon using Bitcoin token platforms due to complex operational procedures\[10]. This high technical barrier severely limits market expansion and adoption.

Liquidity fragmentation is also a major challenge. Different token standards (such as Runes, Ordinals, BRC-20, etc.) trade on different platforms, causing liquidity dispersion and increasing price volatility and slippage risks. Market data shows that additional trading costs due to liquidity fragmentation exceed $500 million annually\[11].

Security risks constitute another key challenge. Centralized trading platforms face risks of hacker attacks and internal vulnerabilities, while fully decentralized solutions may lack sufficient user protection mechanisms. Leading platforms have begun adopting multi-party computation technologies such as Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS) to protect user assets, along with multi-signature contract governance structures. For example, on the Odin platform, smart contract upgrades are managed by a 4-of-7 multi-signature mechanism, and protocol-collected revenue is managed by a 3-of-5 multi-signature mechanism. This decentralized governance model is an important exploration in balancing security and user experience. According to CipherTrace data, cryptocurrency trading platforms lost over $3 billion due to security incidents between 2022-2024\[12]. Balancing security and user experience is the core challenge of the current market.
